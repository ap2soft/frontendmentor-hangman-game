## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Learn how to play Hangman from the main menu.
- Start a game and choose a category.
- Play Hangman with a random word selected from that category.
- See their current health decrease based on incorrect letter guesses.
- Win the game if they complete the whole word.
- Lose the game if they make eight wrong guesses.
- Pause the game and choose to continue, pick a new category, or quit.
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Navigate the entire game only using their keyboard.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox, CSS grid, custom box shadows
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/) - The Progressive JavaScript Framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

### What I learned

Working on this challenge I learned how to make custom box shadows.

In this project I first time worked with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) - a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation.
